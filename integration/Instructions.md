# Chargeback (ES|QL Version) Integration

This document outlines the steps to install the Chargeback integration, which makes use of the `ES|QL LOOKUP JOIN` feature introduced in 8.18.

## Migrate from "module" to integration

If you have already installed the Chargeback "module" and want to rather use the integration, please follow the [Decommisioning](../module/Decommisioning.md) instructions of the module, and then return to these instructions.

## Setup Instructions

To install the Chargeback integration, please follow these steps:

### 1. Meet Prerequisites

See [Requirements](README.md#requirements) for details.

### 2. Create Lookup Indices and Data View: 
- Copy the Index creation commands (below) to Kibana Dev Tools.
- If required, modify the desired values for the `chargeback_conf_lookup` index. Note, these can be changed at a later stage.
    - Change the `conf_*_weight` values to set the blended weight calculations, or use defaults.
    - Change the `conf_ecu_rate` value so that the dashboard is in the desired rate, and `conf_ecu_rate_unit` to the unit representing the rate. For example a rate of `17.6` and unit of `ZAR` will show the cost in South African Rand, wherease a rate of `1` and unit of `USD` will show the cost in United States Dollar.
- Create the required `mode: lookup` indices by executing all of the commands.
- Create the required Kibana data view which is used in the Dashboard control.
